  ## Installation
  1. After cloning the repo to your computer, cd into "Develop".
  2. Run "npm i" and fill out .env.EXAMPLE before renaming it to just ".env".
  3. cd into "db" and run "psql -U postgres".
  4. Run schema.sql and (optionally) seeds.sql.
  5. Exit out and return to "Develop".
  6. Run "npm run build" and then "npm start" to begin.

  ## Usage
  See video:

  ## Contributing
  Feel free to contribute to this project. The code could stand to be modularized, and there is no delete function yet. Currently, the only way to delete anything is to rerun schema.sql, but this deletes everything.

  ## Tests
  Make sure all functions are working correctly, including the option to not have a manager.
